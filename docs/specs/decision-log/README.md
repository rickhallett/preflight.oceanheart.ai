# Decision Log

This folder tracks high‑impact product and technical decisions as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records). Each ADR is concise, immutable once accepted, and linked from PRDs.

How to use
- Create from template: copy `template.md` → `ADR-XXXX-title.md` (increment number).
- Status values: Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated (or Superseded by ADR‑YYYY).
- Keep entries short and actionable; link to PRDs, tickets, and docs.
