  - Commits: 5131457

## Testing Summary
- Tests written: 0 (TDD not applicable for UI components)
- Tests passing: N/A
- Manual verification: Pending full testing with auth system

## Challenges & Solutions
- Challenge 1: Route organization for public vs protected pages
  - Solution: Used Next.js route groups with (public) and (protected) folders
- Challenge 2: Handling authentication redirect URLs for different environments
  - Solution: Environment-aware URL construction in login page and auth utilities

## Critical Security Notes
- Authentication/Authorization changes:
  - Implemented JWT token validation in middleware
  - Protected routes automatically redirect to login
  - Token expiration checking implemented
- Data validation changes:
  - JWT structure validation in middleware
  - Cookie presence checking for protected routes
- Input sanitization:
  - Return URLs are properly encoded
  - No user input directly rendered without encoding

## Next Steps
- Test integration with actual Oceanheart Passport system
- Add error handling for failed authentication
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Add loading states during authentication
- Consider adding session timeout warnings
