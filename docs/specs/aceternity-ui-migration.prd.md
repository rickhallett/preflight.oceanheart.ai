# Aceternity UI Migration PRD

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 14, 2025  
**Author**: Development Team

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the migration of the Preflight application's UI from Skeleton Labs v3 with Tailwind CSS to Aceternity UI, a modern component library focused on animated, interactive components built with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion. The migration aims to enhance user experience with premium animated components while maintaining the existing functionality and Svelte/SvelteKit architecture.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
The Preflight application currently uses:
- **UI Framework**: Skeleton Labs v3 (@skeletonlabs/skeleton: ^3.2.0)
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS v4.1.13
- **Frontend**: Svelte 5 with SvelteKit
- **Components**: Basic navbar, header, footer, and layout components
- **Styling**: Custom Tailwind configuration with design tokens

### Pain Points
1. **Limited Visual Appeal**: Current UI lacks modern animations and visual effects
2. **Basic Interactions**: Components have minimal micro-interactions and user engagement
3. **Generic Design**: Standard UI components don't differentiate the application
4. **Framework Mismatch**: Aceternity UI is primarily designed for React/Next.js, not Svelte

## Requirements

### User Requirements
- **UR-1**: Maintain all existing functionality during migration
- **UR-2**: Improve visual appeal with animated components
- **UR-3**: Enhance user engagement through micro-interactions
- **UR-4**: Preserve responsive design across all devices
- **UR-5**: Maintain authentication flow and user experience

### Technical Requirements
- **TR-1**: Migrate from Skeleton Labs to Aceternity UI components
- **TR-2**: Adapt React/Next.js components to Svelte architecture
- **TR-3**: Integrate Framer Motion animations within Svelte components
- **TR-4**: Maintain Tailwind CSS v4.1.13 compatibility
- **TR-5**: Preserve existing API integration and authentication
- **TR-6**: Ensure build process compatibility with SvelteKit

### Design Requirements
- **DR-1**: Implement animated backgrounds and effects
- **DR-2**: Enhance navigation with floating dock or animated navbar
- **DR-3**: Add visual effects to cards and interactive elements
- **DR-4**: Integrate text effects and typography animations
- **DR-5**: Maintain consistent design system and color scheme

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
**Scope**: Prepare the environment for Aceternity UI integration

**Tasks**:
- Research Framer Motion alternatives for Svelte (svelte-motion, svelte-animations)
- Install necessary animation libraries
- Create component adaptation utilities
- Set up development environment for component conversion
- Document component mapping strategy

**Components Affected**: None (infrastructure only)

### Phase 2: Core Layout Migration
**Scope**: Migrate primary layout components

**Tasks**:
- Convert Navbar.svelte to use Aceternity-style floating navigation
- Enhance Header.svelte with background effects
- Update MainLayout.svelte with animated containers
- Implement responsive grid systems
- Test layout functionality across all pages

**Components Affected**:
- `src/lib/components/Navbar.svelte`
- `src/lib/components/Header.svelte`
- `src/lib/components/MainLayout.svelte`
- `src/routes/+layout.svelte`

### Phase 3: Interactive Elements
**Scope**: Add animated components and micro-interactions

**Tasks**:
- Implement card animations for content containers
- Add button hover effects and animations
- Create animated form inputs
- Integrate loading animations and transitions
- Add scroll-based animations

**Components Affected**:
- Form components in login/survey pages
- Content cards in survey/coach/feedback pages
- Interactive buttons throughout the application

### Phase 4: Visual Effects & Polish
**Scope**: Implement advanced visual effects and animations

**Tasks**:
- Add background effects (sparkles, aurora, meteors)
- Implement text effects for headings and key content
- Create animated backgrounds for landing page
- Add cursor effects and hover interactions
- Optimize animation performance

**Components Affected**:
- `src/lib/components/LandingPage.svelte`
- Page-specific components with text content
- Background elements across all pages

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
**Scope**: Comprehensive testing and performance optimization

**Tasks**:
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness verification
- Performance optimization for animations
- Accessibility testing for animated components
- User acceptance testing
- Documentation updates

**Components Affected**: All migrated components

## Implementation Notes

### Component Conversion Strategy

```typescript
// Example: Converting React Aceternity component to Svelte
// React Aceternity Pattern:
// <FloatingNav navItems={navItems} />

// Svelte Adaptation:
<script lang="ts">
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';
  // Import Svelte animation library equivalent
  
  export let navItems: Array<{name: string, link: string}>;
  
  // Implement floating behavior with Svelte animations
</script>

<nav class="fixed top-0 inset-x-0 z-50">
  <!-- Adapted floating navigation logic -->
</nav>
```

### Animation Library Selection
Primary options for Framer Motion alternative in Svelte:
1. **svelte-motion**: Direct Framer Motion port for Svelte
2. **svelte/animate**: Built-in Svelte animations
3. **svelte/transition**: Native transition effects
4. **Custom CSS + Tailwind**: Manual animation implementation

### Framework Compatibility Matrix

| Aceternity Feature | Svelte Equivalent | Implementation Approach |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Framer Motion | svelte-motion | Direct library replacement |
| React Hooks | Svelte Stores | State management adaptation |
| Next.js Router | SvelteKit Router | Navigation integration |
| React Context | Svelte Context | State sharing adaptation |

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Integration
- **AC-1**: Ensure animated components don't interfere with authentication flow
- **AC-2**: Validate that animations don't expose sensitive user data
- **AC-3**: Maintain secure token handling during UI transitions

### Data Validation
- **DV-1**: Preserve form validation during animated input implementation
- **DV-2**: Ensure animated components properly handle error states
- **DV-3**: Maintain CSRF protection across enhanced forms

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **PM-1**: Page load time remains under 3 seconds
- **PM-2**: Animation frame rate maintains 60fps on desktop, 30fps on mobile
- **PM-3**: Bundle size increase less than 200KB after gzip

### User Experience Metrics
- **UX-1**: User engagement time increases by 20%
- **UX-2**: Bounce rate decreases by 15%
- **UX-3**: User satisfaction score improves (measured through feedback)

### Technical Metrics
- **TM-1**: Zero regression in existing functionality
- **TM-2**: Cross-browser compatibility maintained (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **TM-3**: Mobile responsiveness preserved across all screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 6: Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
- Implement 3D card effects for enhanced content presentation
- Add parallax scrolling effects for engaging user journeys
- Integrate advanced cursor interactions and hover effects
- Create custom animated icons and micro-interactions
- Implement theme transitions with smooth animations

### Component Library Expansion
- Build reusable animated component library for future features
- Create design system documentation with Aceternity adaptations
- Develop component testing suite for animated elements
- Establish performance monitoring for animation-heavy pages

### Integration Opportunities
- Explore Aceternity UI Pro components for premium features
- Consider custom component development based on Aceternity patterns
- Evaluate additional animation libraries for specific use cases
- Plan for component updates as Aceternity UI evolves

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain Svelte 5 and SvelteKit architecture
- Cannot break existing authentication system
- Must preserve API integration patterns
- Requires backward compatibility during migration

### Timeline Constraints
- Migration should be incremental to avoid disrupting users
- Each phase must be fully tested before proceeding
- Performance benchmarks must be met at each phase

### Resource Constraints  
- Development team must learn Aceternity component patterns
- Additional testing required for animation performance
- Potential learning curve for Svelte-specific animation implementation
