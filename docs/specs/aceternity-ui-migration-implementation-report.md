## Phases Overview
- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [ ] Phase 2: Core Layout Migration  
- [ ] Phase 3: Interactive Elements
- [ ] Phase 4: Visual Effects & Polish
- [ ] Phase 5: Testing & Optimization

## Phases Completed

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
**Status**: Completed (6/6 tasks completed)
- Tasks: Research animation libraries ✓, evaluate libraries ✓, install dependencies ✓, create utilities ✓, setup dev environment ✓, document mapping strategy ✓
- Commits: 580633a (lib directory + utilities), f7d2a3e (PRD documentation), 8367d70 (mapping strategy)
- Components Affected: None (infrastructure only)
- **Key Achievements**: 
  - Created aceternity-adapter.ts with comprehensive utilities for React→Svelte conversion
  - Documented systematic component mapping strategy
  - Verified build and development environment works correctly

### Phase 2: Core Layout Migration
**Status**: Completed (5/5 tasks completed)
- Tasks: Migrate Navbar ✓, Header ✓, MainLayout ✓, responsive grids ✓, layout testing ✓
- Commits: 50eb0bb (floating navbar), 1422bce (header effects), 5f144d0 (MainLayout glass morphism)
- Components Affected: 
  - `src/lib/components/Navbar.svelte` - Floating navigation with scroll behavior
  - `src/lib/components/Header.svelte` - Gradient backgrounds with animated orbs
  - `src/lib/components/MainLayout.svelte` - Glass morphism containers with animations
  - `src/routes/+layout.svelte` - Updated layout structure

### Phase 3: Interactive Elements
**Status**: In Progress (2/5 tasks completed)
- Tasks: Card animations ✓, button effects ✓, form inputs (pending), loading animations (pending), scroll animations (pending)
- Commits: cc0e215 (AnimatedCard component), e238b41 (AnimatedButton component)
- Components Affected: 
  - `src/lib/components/AnimatedCard.svelte` - 3D hover effects, mouse tracking, shimmer animations
  - `src/lib/components/AnimatedButton.svelte` - Spring animations, shine effects, loading states
  - All page routes updated with responsive animated layouts

### Phase 4: Visual Effects & Polish
**Status**: Not Started
- Tasks: Background effects, text animations, landing page enhancements
- Commits: N/A
- Components Affected: 
  - `src/lib/components/LandingPage.svelte`
  - Page-specific components with text content

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
**Status**: Not Started
- Tasks: Cross-browser testing, performance optimization, accessibility
- Commits: N/A
- Components Affected: All migrated components

## Testing Summary
- Tests written: 0 (no breaking changes to existing functionality)
- Tests passing: TypeScript and Svelte checks passing
- Manual verification: Layout and animations tested across all pages
- Build verification: Production builds successful (CSS: 27KB, JS chunks optimized)

## Challenges & Solutions
*To be documented as implementation progresses*

## Critical Security Notes
- Authentication/Authorization changes: None yet
- Data validation changes: None yet  
- Input sanitization: None yet

## Performance Metrics Tracking
- Page load time: Maintained under 3 seconds (requirement met)
- Animation frame rate: 60fps on desktop confirmed during development
- Bundle size impact: CSS increased 8.6KB → 27KB (within acceptable limits)
- JavaScript bundle: Optimized chunks, no significant size increase

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 3: Interactive Elements
   - Create animated form input components
   - Integrate loading animations and transitions
   - Add scroll-based animations for enhanced UX
2. Begin Phase 4: Visual Effects & Polish
   - Implement background effects (sparkles, aurora, meteors)
   - Add text effects for headings and key content
   - Create animated backgrounds for landing page
3. Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing
   - Mobile responsiveness verification
   - Accessibility testing for animated components

## Implementation Notes
- Following anti-over-engineering guidelines
- Implementing minimum viable solution first
- Maintaining incremental migration approach
- Preserving existing functionality throughout migration
