## Phases Completed

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
**Status**: Not Started
- Tasks: Research animation libraries, install dependencies, create utilities
- Commits: N/A
- Components Affected: None (infrastructure only)

### Phase 2: Core Layout Migration
**Status**: Not Started
- Tasks: Migrate Navbar, Header, MainLayout components
- Commits: N/A
- Components Affected: 
  - `src/lib/components/Navbar.svelte`
  - `src/lib/components/Header.svelte`
  - `src/lib/components/MainLayout.svelte`
  - `src/routes/+layout.svelte`

### Phase 3: Interactive Elements
**Status**: Not Started
- Tasks: Add animations to cards, buttons, forms, and transitions
- Commits: N/A
- Components Affected: Form components, content cards, interactive buttons

### Phase 4: Visual Effects & Polish
**Status**: Not Started

## Testing Summary
- Tests written: 0
- Tests passing: 0
- Manual verification: Not started

## Challenges & Solutions
*To be documented as implementation progresses*

## Critical Security Notes
- Authentication/Authorization changes: None yet
- Data validation changes: None yet  
- Input sanitization: None yet

## Performance Metrics Tracking
- Page load time baseline: To be measured
- Animation frame rate: To be monitored
- Bundle size baseline: To be measured

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 1: Foundation Setup
   - Research Svelte animation libraries
   - Install necessary dependencies
   - Create component adaptation utilities
2. Document any deviations from PRD
3. Track performance metrics throughout implementation

## Implementation Notes
- Following anti-over-engineering guidelines
- Implementing minimum viable solution first
- Maintaining incremental migration approach
- Preserving existing functionality throughout migration
