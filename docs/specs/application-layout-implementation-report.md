- Tests passing: 0
- Manual verification: Pending

## Challenges & Solutions
- Challenge 1: Integration of two PRDs
  - Solution: Implemented as sequential phases, with login page replacing stubbed auth

## Critical Security Notes
- Authentication/Authorization changes: Implementing secure JWT handling with HttpOnly cookies

- Input sanitization: URL parameter validation in callback endpoint

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation with Skeleton UI setup
- Create modular components for reusability
- Ensure secure authentication flow
